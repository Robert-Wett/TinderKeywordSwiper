TinderAutoLiker
===============

The premise for this experiment is to run each image of a tinder 'potential match' against the clarifai.com image API analysis, and 'liking' the entry if it matches certain criteria. I'm going to start with something basic like black men/women vs. white men/women to see how accurate the results are from clarafai (they are actually amazingly good at this stuff, I think skin-tone will be able to be grokked easily and will hopefully be a keyword in the return). 

###Quick Payload Example
This is an example of what clarafai can do with a generic picture of a white woman vs. a generic picture of a black women. I literally google image searched 'white woman' and 'black woman'. From my immediate experience, I think the 'multiethnic' keyword will play a big part in things. Anyways, here's the example:
